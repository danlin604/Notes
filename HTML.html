    HTML5 Components
/* -------------------------------------------------- */

section

  Used for grouping together thematically-related content. Sounds like a div element, but it’s not. The div has no semantic meaning. Before replacing all your div’s with section elements, always ask yourself: “Is all of the content related?”

aside

  Used for tangentially related content. Just because some content appears to the left or right of the main content isn’t enough reason to use the aside element. Ask yourself if the content within the aside can be removed without reducing the meaning of the main content. Pullquotes are an example of tangentially related content.

header

  There is a crucial difference between the header element and the general accepted usage of header (or masthead). There’s usually only one header or ‘masthead’ in a page. In HTML5 you can have as many as you want. The spec defines it as “a group of introductory or navigational aids”. You can use a header in any section on your site. In fact, you probably should use a header within most of your sections. The spec describes the section element as “a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.”

nav

  Intended for major navigation information. A group of links grouped together isn’t enough reason to use the nav element. Site-wide navigation, on the other hand belongs in a nav element.

footer

  Sounds like its a description of the position, but its not. Footer elements contain informations about its containing element: who wrote it, copyright, links to related content, etc. Whereas we usually have one footer for an entire document, HTML5 allows us to also have footer within sections.


Usage:

<body>
 <h1>page title</h1>

  <nav>
   <h1>navigation</h1>
  </nav>

  <aside>
   <h1>tangentially related to the topic at hand</h1>
  </aside>

  <article></article>

  <article>
    <h1>named article</h1>
  </article>

  <h2>untyped section, sibling 
      of the last article</h2>

Usage:

<body>

 <h3>if you want siblings at top level</h3>

 <h3>you have to use untyped sections with <hX> </h3>
  
  <article>
   <h1>as any section will descent</h1>
  </article>

  <nav>
   <ul><li><a href=...>...</a></li></ul>
  </nav>




What is the difference between <article> and <section>?

  both can:

    be nested in each other

    take a different notion in a different context or nesting level

  <section>s are like book chapters

    they usually have siblings (maybe in a different document?)

    together they have something in common, like chapters in a book

  one author, one <article>... at least on the lowest level

    standard example: a single blog comment

    a blog entry itself is also a good example

    a blog entry <article> and its comment <article>s could also be wrapped with an <article>

    it’s some “complete” thing, not a part in a series of similar

  <section>s in an <article> are like chapters in a book

  <article>s in a <section> are like poems in a volume (within a series)


How do <header>, <footer> and <main> fit in?

  they have zero influence on sectioning

  <header> and <footer>

    they allow you to mark zones of each and every section

    even within a section you can have them several times

    to differentiate from the main part in this section

    limited only by the author’s taste

  <header>
    
    may mark the title/name of this section

    may contain a logo for this section

    has no need to be at the top or upper part of the section

  <footer>

    may mark the credits/author of this section

    can come at the top of the section

    can even be above a <header>

  <main>

    only allowed once

    marks the main part of the top level section (i.e. the document, <body> that is)

    subsections themselves have no markup for their main part

    <main> can even “hide” in some subsections of the document, while document’s <header> and <footer> can’t (that markup would mark header/footer of that subsection then)

      but it is not allowed in <article> sections4

    helps to distinguish “the real thing” from document’s non-header, non-footer, non-main content, if that makes sense in your case...  


/* -------------------------------------------------- */
    Data form validation
/* -------------------------------------------------- */

While you should always validate data on your servers, additional validation of data on the Web page itself has multiple benefits. In many ways, users are annoyed by forms. By validating form data while the user is filling it out, the user can know immediately if they've made any mistakes; this saves the time of waiting for an HTTP response and saves your server from dealing with bad form input.

:invalid CSS pseudo class


  <input id="choose" name="i_like" pattern="banana|cherry" required>

  <input type="number" min="12" max="120" step="1" id="n1" name="age" pattern="\d+">

  <input type="text" id="t1" name="fruit" list="l1" required pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry">

  <input type="email" name="email">

  <textarea id="t3" name="msg" maxlength="140" rows="5"></textarea>

Radio

  <fieldset>
    <legend>Title<abbr title="This field is mandatory">*</abbr></legend>
    <input type="radio" required name="title" id="r1" value="Mr" ><label for="r1">Mr. </label>
    <input type="radio" required name="title" id="r2" value="Ms"><label for="r2">Ms.</label>
  </fieldset>


Customized error messages

  There is no standard way to change their look and feel with CSS.

  They depend on the browser locale, which means that you can have a page in one language but an error message displayed in another language.

  Use JavaScript to customize appearance and text.

Example

<form>
  <label for="mail">I would like you to provide me an e-mail</label>
  <input type="email" id="mail" name="mail">
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>

var email = document.getElementById("mail");

email.addEventListener("keyup", function (event) {
  if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {
    email.setCustomValidity("I expect an e-mail, darling!");
  } else {
    email.setCustomValidity("");
  }
});


/* -------------------------------------------------- */
    Web Components
/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Web Components consists of several separate technologies. You can think of Web Components as reusable user interface widgets that are created using open Web technology. They are part of the browser, and so they do not need external libraries like jQuery or Dojo. An existing Web Component can be used without writing code, simply by adding an import statement to an HTML page. Web Components use new or still-developing standard browser capabilities.

Sometimes there is some confusion regarding Web Components and Google Polymer. Polymer is a framework that is based on Web Components technologies. You can make and use Web Components without Polymer.

Web Components are not fully implemented in all browsers yet, and so to use them right now in most browsers (January 2015) you will probably need to use polyfills to fill in the gaps in browser coverage. Polyfills are available in the Google Polymer project. To find out which browsers implement Web Components, see Are We Componentized Yet?

    Canvas
/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Sceen coordinate system

Images are loaded asynchronously


<canvas id="c" width="200" height="200"></canvas>

<script>
	var c = document.querySelector("#c");
	var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
	
	var image = new Image();

	image.onload = function() {
		console.log("Loaded image");
		ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, c.width, c.height);
	}

	image.src = "picture.png";
</script>


/* -------------------------------------------------- */
    Async JavaScript
/* -------------------------------------------------- */

<script src="analytics.js" async></script>

	Does not block DOM construction!

	Does not block CSSOM!

	We use async when JS does not affect the critical rendering path.

Alternative is to use the onload event.

    General Strategies and CRP Diagrams
/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Minify, Compress, Cache

	HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Minimizer use of render blocking resources (CSS)	

	Use mmedia queries on <link> to unblock rendering

	Inline CSS

Minimize use of parser blocking resources (JS)

	Defer JavaScript execution

	Use async attribute on <script>




Buckets:

	Reduce the amount of data sent, minimize bytes

	Reduce critical resources (CSS & JS)

	Shorten CRP length
