	DOM
/* -------------------------------------------------- */


DOM

	A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.

    <p style="color:red;">This is my first CSS example</p>

    The only time you might have to resort to using inline styles is when your working environment is really restrictive (perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body.)

/* -------------------------------------------------- */
	Selectors
/* -------------------------------------------------- */


Simple selectors

	Match one or more elements based on element type, class, or id.

	/* All p elements are red */
	p {
	  color: red;
	}

	/* The element with the class "first" is bolded */
	.first {
	  font-weight: bold;
	}


Handling multiple classes

	/* CSS */
	.base-box {
	  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.1), rgba(0,0,0,0.3));
	  padding: 3px 3px 3px 7px;
	}

	.important {
	  font-weight: bold;
	}

	.editor-note {
	  background-color: #9999ff;
	  border-left: 6px solid #333399;
	}

	.warning {
	  background-color: #ff9999;
	  border-left: 6px solid #993333;
	}

	/* HTML */
	<p class="base-box warning important">My first paragraph.</p>



ID selectors

	#polite {
	  font-family: cursive;
	}



Universal Selector

	Careful when using the universal selector. As it applies to all elements, using it in large web pages can have a perceptible impact on performance: web pages can be displayed slower than expected. There are not many instances where you'd want to use this selector.

	* {
	  padding: 5px;
	  border: 1px solid black;
	  background: rgba(255,0,0,0.25)
	}


/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Attribute selectors

	Match one or more elements based on their attributes/attribute values.

	Attribute selectors are a special kind of selector that will match elements based on their attributes and attribute values. Their generic syntax consists of square brackets ([]) containing an attribute name followed by an optional condition to match against the value of the attribute. Attribute selectors can be divided into two categories depending on the way they match attribute values: Presence and value attribute selectors and Substring value attribute selectors.

	<ul>
		<li data-quantity="2kg" data-meat>Chicken</li>
		<li data-quantity="1kg" data-vegetable>Tomatoes</li>
		<li data-quantity="optional 10ml" data-vegetable="liquid">Olive oil</li>
		<li data-quantity="700g" data-vegetable="not spicy like chili">Red pepper</li>
	</ul>


	[data-vegetable] {
		color: green
	}


	[data-vegetable="liquid"] {
		color: green
	}

	[data-vegetable~="spicy"] {
		color: red;
	}

Substring Value Selectors


	[attr|=val]
		
		This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value is exactly val or starts with val- (careful, the dash here isn't a mistake, this is to handle language codes.)

	[attr^=val]

		This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value starts with val.

	[attr$=val]

		This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value ends with val.

	[attr*=val]

		This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value contains the string val (unlike [attr~=val], this selector doesn't treat spaces as value separators but as part of the attribute value.)

	[lang|=fr] {
		font-weight: bold;
	}

	/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable" containing
	the value "not spicy" are turned back to green */
	[data-vegetable*="not spicy"] {
		color: green;
	}

	/* All elements with the attribute "data-quantity", for which
	the value ends with "kg" */
	[data-quantity$="kg"] {
		font-weight: bold;
	}

	/* All elements with the attribute "data-quantity", for which the
	value starts with "optional" */
	[data-quantity^="optional"] {
		opacity: 0.5;
	}

/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Pseudo-classes

	Match one or more elements that exist in a certain state, such as an element that is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox that is currently disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.

	A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword preceded by a colon (:) that is added on to the end of selectors to specify that you want to style the selected elements only when they are in certain state.

	:active
	:any
	:checked
	:default
	:dir()
	:disabled
	:empty
	:enabled
	:first
	:first-child
	:first-of-type
	:fullscreen
	:focus
	:hover
	:indeterminate
	:in-range
	:invalid
	:lang()
	:last-child
	:last-of-type
	:left
	:link
	:not()
	:nth-child()
	:nth-last-child()
	:nth-last-of-type()
	:nth-of-type()
	:only-child
	:only-of-type
	:optional
	:out-of-range
	:read-only
	:read-write
	:required
	:right
	:root
	:scope
	:target
	:valid
	:visited



	a:visited {
		color: blue;
	}

	a:hover,
	a:active,
	a:focus {
		color: darkred;
		text-decoration: none;
	}


/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Pseudo-elements

	Match one or more parts of content that are in a certain position in relation to an element, for example the first word of each paragraph, or generated content appearing just before an element.

	Pseudo-elements are very much like pseudo-classes, but they have differences. They are keywords — this time preceded by two colons (::) — that can be added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of an element.

	::after
	::before
	::first-letter
	::first-line
	::selection
	::backdrop

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">CSS</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">HTML</a></li>
	</ul>

	/* All elements with an attribute "href", which values
	start with "http", will be added an arrow after its
	content (to indicate it's an external link) */
	[href^=http]::after {
		content: '>';
	}


/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Combinators

	These are not exactly selectors themselves, but ways of combining two or more selectors in useful ways for very specific selections. So for example, you could select only paragraphs that are direct descendants of divs, or paragraphs that come directly after headings.


AB	
	
	Any element matching both A and B at the same time.

A B	

	Any element matching B that is a descendant of an element matching A (that is: a child, or a child of a child, etc.)

A > B

	Any element matching B that is a direct child of an element matching A.

A + B	

	Any element matching B that is the next sibling of an element matching A (that is: the next child of the same parent.)

A ~ B

	Any element matching B that is among the next sibling of an element matching A (that is: one of the next children of the same parent.)


	/* All <td>s within a <table> and all <th>s within a <table>
	   Comma is not a combinator, it just allows you to target
	   several selectors with the same CSS ruleset */
	table td, table th {
		border : 1px solid black;
		padding: 0.5em 0.5em 0.4em;
	}


	/* All <th>s within <thead>s that are within <table>s */
	table thead th {
		color: white;
		background: black;
	}

	/* All <td>s preceded by another <td>,
	within a <tbody>, within a <table> */
	table tbody td + td {
		text-align: center;
	}

	/* All <td>s that are a last child,
	within a <tbody>, within a <table> */
	table tbody td:last-child {
		text-align: right
	}

	/* All <th>s, within a <tfoot>s, within a <table> */
	table tfoot th {
		text-align: right;
		border-top-width: 5px;
		border-left: none;
		border-bottom: none;
	}

	/* All <td>s preceded by a <th>, within a <table> */
	table th + td {
		text-align: right;
		border-top-width: 5px;
		color: white;
		background: black;
	}

	/* All pseudo-elements "before" <td>s that are a last child,
	appearing within elements with a class of "with-currency" that
	also have an attribute "lang" with the value "en-US" */
	.with-currency[lang="en-US"] td:last-child::before {
		content: '$';
	}

	/* All pseudo-elements "after" <td>s that are a last child,
	appearing within elements with the class "with-currency" that
	also have an attribute "lang" with the value "fr" */
	.with-currency[lang="fr"] td:last-child::after {
		content: ' €';
	}

/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Multiple selectors

	You can write multiple selectors separated by commas, to apply the same rule to multiple sets of selected elements at once.

	h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
		font-family: helvetica, 'sans serif';
	}


/* -------------------------------------------------- */
	SMACSS : Scalable and Modular Architecture CSS
/* -------------------------------------------------- */


Base

	This include selector rules. No classes or id here. This is to reset browser rules and set a base style for elements which are going to be consistent and reused. You are defining here the default style for your elements. This can include html, body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, img, a…

Layout

	This is where the style used to lay out your pages will sit. It should be separated to your module style for flexibility. You want to be able to use your layout style to build your pages in the most flexible way possible. A module or components should be added to any place in your site independent from the layout.

Modules

	A module is a part or a component of your page. Your menu, dialog box, download list or any widget you have on your page. It depends of your design.

	A module is independent from your layout so it can live anywhere in you app. You should be able to copy/paste the html and move somewhere else, and it will look and behave the same.

	A module should be encapsulated in one file and easily accessible. It will be easy to find and you’ll be in control of what you want to update as it won’t be depending on any other style.

States

	A state will be a style which modifies or overrides other rules. A great example is accordion when collapsing or expanding elements. Using a `is-collapsed` class will make sure your element is collapsed. This is a good place to use !important (and probably the only one) as you want this state to be applied no matter what. Also, it can relate to modified state with javascript.

	Good practise is to prefix or add a namespace to those states classes like is- or has-: is-hidden, is-displayed, is-collapsed, has-children, etc

Theme

	Idea is to have a file called theme.css where you can define all the theme rules.

	// box.scss
	.box {
	  border: 1px solid;
	}
	// theme.scss
	.box {
	  border-color: red;
	}


/* -------------------------------------------------- */
	CSS Values and Units
/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Numeric values

	Length values for specifying e.g. element width, border thickness, or font size, and unitless integers for specifying e.g. relative line width or number of times to run an animation.

Percentages

	Can also be used to specify size or length — relative to a parent container's width or height for example, or the default font-size.

Colors

	For specifying background colors, text colors, etc.

Coordinate positions

	e.g. for specifying the position of a positioned element relative to the top left of the screen.

Functions

	For specifying e.g. background images or background image gradients.


/* -------------------------------------------------- */

Length and Size

	margin: 5px;
	padding: 10px;
	border: 2px
	width: 150px;
	font-size: 18px;

	px (pixel)

		absolute units, same size regardless of any other related settings
		
	mm, cm, in

		Millimeters, centimeters, or inches

	pt, pc

		Points (1/72 of an inch) or picas (12 points.)

	em

		1em is the same as the font-size of the current element (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M.) The default base font-size given to web pages by web browsers before CSS styling is applied is 16 pixels, which means the computed value of 1em is 16 pixels for an element by default. But beware — font sizes are inherited by elements from their parents, so if different font sizes have been set on parent elements, the pixel equivalent of an em can start to become complicated.

	ex, ch

		Respectively these are the height of a lower case x, and the width of the number 0. These are not as commonly used or well-supported as ems.

	rem

		The rem (root em) works in exactly the same way as the em, except that it will always equal the size of the default base font-size; inherited font sizes will have no effect, so this sounds like a much better option than ems, although rems don't work in older versions of Internet Explorer.

	vw, vh

		Respectively these are 1/100th of the width of the viewport, and 1/100th of the height of the viewport. Again, these are not as widely supported as rems.

Unitless Values

	For example, if you want to completely remove the margin or padding from an element, you can just use unitless 0 — 0 is 0, no matter what units were set before!

	margin: 0;

	line-height: 1.5;

CSS Animations

	@keyframes rotate {
		0% {
			transform: rotate(0deg);
		}

		100% {
			transform: rotate(360deg);
		}
	}

	p:hover {
		animation-name: rotate;
		animation-duration: 0.6s;
		animation-timing-function: linear;
		animation-iteration-count: 5;
	}

Percentages

	font-size: 200%;
	width: 75%;

Colour

	Hexadecimal values

		background-color: #ff0000; /* red */

	RGB

		background-color: rgb(255,0,0);

	HSL

		Slightly less well supported than RGB is the HSL model (not on old versions of IE), which was implemented after much interest from designers — instead of red, green and blue values, the hsl() function accepts hue, saturation, and lightness values, which are used to distinguish between the 16.7 million colors, but in a different way

		hue

			the base shade of the color. This takes a value between 0 and 360, presenting the angles round a color wheel.

		saturation

			how saturated is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and 100% is full color saturation

		lightness

			how light, or bright is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100% is full light (it will appear completely white)

		background-color: hsl(0,100%,50%);
		background-color: hsl(240,100%,50%);

	RGBA (transparency)

		background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.5);

	HSLA (transparency)

		background-color: hsla(240,100%,50%,0.5);

	Obacity

		opacity: 0.5;
